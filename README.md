# crack-code-ai
Trying to find the best AI to be the best at the Crack Code game using genetic algorithm and neural networks.

### How to run
Using python 3.7:
```bash
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

```bash
python genetic_algorithm.py
```
to train the genetic algorithm from the last checkpoint (each checkpoint is at 10 generations).
to start over just delete the 'checkpoint' folder.

to just play the crack code game:
```bash
python game.py
```
